# Image-classification---Machine-Learning
I used the Azure Custom Vision service to train a custom image classification model, and then deployed the model to a prediction service for consumption

The custom image classification model was trained to recognize if in an image was either a cat or a dog.

The model was trained and deployed in python:

The code uses the Project Id, and the Key and endpoint of the resource group to connect to the model.

The model was exported as a Tensorflow project too.
